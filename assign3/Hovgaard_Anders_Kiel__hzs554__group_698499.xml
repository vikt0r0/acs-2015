      <title>Description of implementation and tests</title>
      <q1a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a clear description of the approach
          used to achieve before-or-after atomicity?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q1a>
      <q1b>
        <text>

      </q1b>
      <q1c>
        <text>
          Does the code include implementations of Tests 1 and 2 of the
          assignment description as well as of at least another two test
          cases?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q1c>
      <q1d-i>
        <text>
          Is it tested that the final state resulting from concurrent
          execution
          is correct in that it respects invariants designed in the test?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q1d-i>
      <q1d-ii>
        <text>
          Is it tested that intermediate reads of the state during concurrent
          execution respect invariants designed in the test, so that it is
          arguable that these intermediate states could be found in an
          equivalent serial schedule?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q1d-ii>
      <q1e>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found that any portions of the test
          descriptions were unclear according to the criteria, and suggestions for
          improvement

      <title>Correctness argument for locking protocol</title>
      <q2a>
        <text>
          Is the variant of 2PL to which equivalence is being established in
          the correctness argument clearly identified (e.g., conservative, strict,
          conservative strict)?

      </q2a>
      <q2b>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argumentation of why the steps in the locking
          protocol designed correspond to steps taken in the chosen variant
          of 2PL?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
