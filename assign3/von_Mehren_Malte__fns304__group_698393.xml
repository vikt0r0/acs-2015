    <question1>
      <title>Description of implementation and tests</title>
      <q1a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a clear description of the approach
          used to achieve before-or-after atomicity?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1a>
      <q1b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on any aspects that you found unclear in the
          description of the approach to achieve before-or-after atomicity
        </text>
        <answer>Description is clear</answer>
      </q1b>
      <q1c>
        <text>
          Does the code include implementations of Tests 1 and 2 of the
          assignment description as well as of at least another two test
          cases?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1c>
      <q1d-i>
        <text>
          Is it tested that the final state resulting from concurrent
          execution
          is correct in that it respects invariants designed in the test?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-i>
      <q1d-ii>
        <text>
          Is it tested that intermediate reads of the state during concurrent
          execution respect invariants designed in the test, so that it is
          arguable that these intermediate states could be found in an
          equivalent serial schedule?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-ii>
      <q1e>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found that any portions of the test
          descriptions were unclear according to the criteria, and suggestions for
          improvement
        </text>
        <answer>The tests passes, are correctly implemented and the descriptions
        are clear on what the tests intends to show.</answer>
      </q1e>
    </question1>

    <question2>
      <title>Correctness argument for locking protocol</title>
      <q2a>
        <text>
          Is the variant of 2PL to which equivalence is being established in
          the correctness argument clearly identified (e.g., conservative, strict,
          conservative strict)?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2a>
      <q2b>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argumentation of why the steps in the locking
          protocol designed correspond to steps taken in the chosen variant
          of 2PL?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2b>
      <q2c>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>NO</answer>
      </q2c>
      <q2d>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found any aspects of the correctness
          argument provided to be lacking, incorrect, or in need of improvement.
        </text>
        <answer>The implemented locking protocol could be improved by increased
        granularity i.e. claiming exclusive locks on individual books rather
        than the entire bookMap structure. Also, the description doesn't
        mention predicate reads.</answer>
      </q2d>
    </question2>

    <question3>
      <title>Deadlocks</title>
      <q3a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a correct argument for why deadlocks can
          occur in the locking protocol or why deadlocks cannot occur?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q3a>
      <q3b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument provided with respect to
          deadlocks could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>Nothing to add</answer>
      </q3b>
    </question3>

    <question4>
      <title>Reflections on scalability</title>
      <q4a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument about the scalability limits of the
          concurrent implementation provided?
        </text>
        <answer>NO</answer>
      </q4a>
      <q4b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the reflections on scalability could be
          improved
        </text>
        <answer>The argument presented is actually an argument for
        concurrency. An argument for scalability has to deal with how
        the performance of the bookstore is affected by adding more hardware to
        a single machine and distributing across several machines.</answer>
      </q4b>
    </question4>

    <question5>
      <title>Argumentation on decisions made for performance</title>
      <q5a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument in the solution about the trade-off between
          locking overhead and concurrency?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q5a>
      <q5b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument about performance trade-offs in
          the locking protocol could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>Very good.</answer>
